# Attendance_Register

IDEA / PLAN:
This is the attendance register. The concept behind this is that users will be able to log their attendance against a pre-defined list of attendees, captured in am object.
A simple UI will be created with html & css. js will be used for DOM manipulation & event handling. The programme will check the inputted name against the pre-defined attendees
list. If there are multiple people with the same name, the programme will verify by asking for a D.O.B

Anyone not on the attendee list will be prompted to enter their details to be added to the list.

EXTRA IDEA:
A separate page which checks if people have checked in or not, or reporting if the person does not exist in the pre-defined attendees list.
