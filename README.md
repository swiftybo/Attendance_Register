# Attendance_Register

PRINCIPLES PRACTICED:

- first 'personal' (i.e. non-course) project from scratch (i.e. blank page)
- creating html elements (from scratch)
- UI creation with css, including placement of elements with flexbox
- class definition & organisation
- DOM manipulation & event handlers
- how to manipulate an array of objects

Welcome to the Attendance Register! This is an application which asks the user to input their full name (case sensitive). The inputted name is checked against a pre-defined list of names and will return if they have been successfully registered (meaning they are included on the 'invite/attendee list') or if they are not included, will notify them they are not invited and display a new form asking them to input their details to add them to the list.

INITIAL IDEA / PLAN:
This is the attendance register. The concept behind this is that users will be able to log their attendance against a pre-defined list of attendees, captured in am object.
A simple UI will be created with html & css. js will be used for DOM manipulation & event handling. The programme will check the inputted name against the pre-defined attendees
list. If there are multiple people with the same name, the programme will verify by asking for a D.O.B

Anyone not on the attendee list will be prompted to enter their details to be added to the list.

EXTRA IDEA:
A separate page which checks if people have checked in or not, or reporting if the person does not exist in the pre-defined attendees list.
